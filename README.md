## Summary

Designed for use with [GitHub Classroom](https://classroom.github.com/), this repository contains the assignment for Laboratory 3 assignment in Computer Science 403.

This laboratory assignment invites you to work individually to participate in the hash identification and hash cracking activities on TryHackMe, and to create and test an encyption and decryption in a Python program. You are also responsible for writing a detailed reflection, stored in the file `reflection.md`. This is a Markdown file that must adhere to the standards described in the [Markdown Syntax Guide](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

## Objectives

To further understanding of encyption and hashing. To practice cracking hashes, explore hashing vulnerabilities, and to experiment with a variety of tools available for exploitation.

## Code of Conduct

Throughout the completion of this project you must adhere to the [community guidelines](https://github.com/CMPSC403-AlleghenyCollege-Fall2021/community_guidelines) that we developed as a class. In addition to reporting any violations of the code of conduct, please make sure that you have followed the code of conduct during this lab. Students who think that the class should revise some aspect of the guidelines must use the GitHub issue tracker for that repository to suggest, discuss, and implement any required changes.

## Assignment Specification

In this lab you will continue with the hash identification and cracking exploration, specifically by experimenting how to crack hashes by using available tools. You are then invited to explore the concept of encryption and decryption by implementing an algorithm of your choice in Python on this topic. Then, you are to experiment with your program by partnering with a colleague in class to send each other secure meassages. Finally, you are invited to reflect on your experiences in a Markdown file given in this repository.

1. Lab 2.1: [Hash Cracking]()
2. Lab 2.2:  Create a Python program that encrypts a secret message in an algorithm of your choice. Then, demontrate how the encryption and decryption can work to send secure messages.

## Required Deliverables

This assignment invites you to submit the following deliverables.

1. Lab 2.1 on TryHackMe.
3. Lab 2.2: A Python program with an encyrption algorithm implementation. The original Python program and its exploitation submitted via your lab 03 repository.
4. Reflection document submitted via your lab02 repository.

## Recommended Timeline

To take the best advantage of the content covered in class, it is recommended that you scaffold the completion of lab 3 in the following manner:

1. Complete Lab 2.1 before lab on Friday, October 15th.
2. Complete Lab 2.2 before lab on Friday, Octber 22nd.

## Assignment Assessment

The grade that a student receives on this assignment will have the following components.

- **Mastery of Technical Writing [up to 15%]:**: Students will receive a part of their grade when the responses to the writing questions presented in the `reflection.md` reveal a proficiency of both writing skills and technical knowledge. To receive a checkmark grade, the submitted writing should have correct spelling, grammar, and punctuation in addition to following the rules of Markdown and providing conceptually and technically accurate answers.

- **Mastery of Technical Knowledge and Skills [up to 85%]**: Students will receive a full portion of this part of their assignment grade when their completed assignments on TryHackMe for this lab reveal that they have mastered all of the technical knowledge and skills developed during the completion of this lab. As a part of this grade, the instructor will assess aspects of the lab including, but not limited to, the number of questions completed and the points received on TryHackMe platform.

All grades for this project will be reported through a student's gradebook GitHub repository and the solution will be posted after the deadline in the [starter lab 02 repository](https://github.com/CMPSC403-AlleghenyCollege-Fall2021/lab03).

## Receiving Assistance

If you are having trouble completing any part of this project, then please talk with the course instructor during the lab session. Alternatively, you may ask questions in the Discord channel for this course. Finally, you can schedule a meeting during the course instructor's office hours.
